									<h2>Legacy</h2>
									<p>The word &#39;<i>Aaruush</i>&#39; translates to &#39;the first rays of the sun&#39;. And that&#39;s what it was, at the time of its inception back in 2007, the rays of the sun, which would eventually enlighten the lives of many people for years to come. Started by four visionary final year students of the college, Aaruush was initially intended to be a technical fest; consisting of 26 events and over 3000 participants, but it has exceeded the expectations of all. And so successful was the idea, that the inauguration was presided over by the former president of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.</p>
									<p>"Seek and you shall find, when you feel everything is lost, innovation will guide you through" his words still echo in the minds of many and has taken Aaruush to the position where it stands now. After its noteworthy beginning in 2007, there was no looking back, it only kept getting better each year. The following year saw Aaruush go national, with over 4500 participants from over 24 states. It was in 2009 that Aaruush evolved from merely a technical fest, to a Techno-Management extravaganza, as we included two new domains - Fundaz and Online. The reputation of Aaruush kept growing, having tie ups with organizations like European Southern Observatory, IEEE, European Space Agency, and had DRDO unveil its latest technology in the form of the 'Arjun' tank. Reputed NGO's like PETA, HOPE, CRY associated with Aaruush, reflect its social responsibility. And it only got better, Aaruush 2012 and 2013 hosted several stalwarts of repute such as Dr. Richard Matthew Stallman, Mr. Rajan Anandan, Dr. Tessy Thomas, Mr. Aakash Sinha, all sharing their knowledge with the participants. Aaruush 2014 saw us welcome eminent personalities such as Dr. Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, Anuraag Batra, Dr. Eshwar Natarajan and also welcomed Mr. Sam Pitroda, all the way from America, with the help of state of the art video conferencing technology.</p>
									<p>Aaruush that year, witnessed an unprecedented footfall, crossing 37000 and set another record, being the platform where the new Arjun Mk II tank was first unraveled. And for those who thought a Techno-Management fest was only about education, Aaruush proved that it was way more, by conducting light and sound shows, Pro shows and the famous Aaruush-Nites that attracted the masses by the thousands. The various expos that took place, including the coins expo, the newspaper expo, the Indian Army Weapons Expo and the Auto Expo were prime attractions as the 8th edition of the fest came to a grand end.</p>
									<p>The 12th edition of Aaruush saw a footfall of 70,000, over 10 workshops, 10 luminary addresses, 60+ events, thrilling challenges and championships and a plethora of learning opportunities hand in hand with fun and intellectually stimulating activities. Our race towards infinity is fast-paced and reaching higher standards as we go. Aaruush ’19 is going to reach greater heights; we’ve seen the black-hole now so for team Aaruush the sky is also no limit.</p>

									<p>"Towards Infinity"
										<br>Getting across the message of the need for innovations and technical breakthroughs to create a benchmark in the industry and make an actual difference. We believe in overcoming obstacles and exceeding expectations with tireless hard work and dedication.</p>
									<p>These are just few of the words we use to describe things that are Infinite. Aaruush uses these ideas to create a platform showcasing a plethora of talent. We find infinity in the number of stars in the night sky, the number of raindrops in an ocean, the memories hidden behind the lens of an eye and the number of ideas that emerge out of minds alike.</p>
									<p>Aaruush towards Infinity leads these minds towards the path of inspiration, discovery, growth and achievement. It brings out the talents of more than 40,000 of its participants with utmost enthusiasm and gratification. With mind-boggling events and eye-catching highlights, Aaruush ’19 steps into its 13th year with the ambition of leaping across the stars and furthering the very definition of infinity.</p>
									<p>Motto of Aaruush:</p>
									<p><b>"Rising in the spirit of innovation"</b></p>
									<p>Striving to change the world with the power of innovation and cumulative efforts of bright ignited minds to bridge the gap between technological advancements and societal expectations is the bedrock of Aaruush. We believe in constantly rising and approaching problems with innovative solutions to make the world a sound place to live in.</p>
