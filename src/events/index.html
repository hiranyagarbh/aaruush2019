				<h2>"Winter is here"</h2>
				<p><strong>Theme: Game of Thrones</strong></p>
				<p>Description:<br>“There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.” The threat of the white walkers has been present ever since the beginning, but never stronger than right now. The Night King with his army of dead containing millions, now poses a grave peril to the mere existence of the Seven Kingdoms, let alone the Iron Throne and who sits on it. Are you Cersie Lannsiter? Who would do anything for the existence of the family name? Or the cunning Littlefinger, the humble snake, one who knows that knowledge is power and chaos is a ladder? Or the just, kind yet ferocious Daenerys Targaryen? Whatever it may be, as the wise man quotes ”VALAR MOGHULIS” So come join hands with other houses, form allies, strategize, manage, plan, form armies, resurrect your kingdom and defeat the Night King.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 1: “Winter is coming”</strong><br>The long winter is coming and the dead are coming with it, thus there is only one person that can stay alive and sit on the iron throne. Do you deserve to be alive? Do you deserve to sit on the great iron throne? Are you capable of leading your army? You will be assigned characters from GOT and you have to fight it out and prove that you are the one who deserves to stay alive, who is capable enough to lead their own army.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 2: “Build your houses”</strong><br>Name your houses, get strategic people on board for eg. Army heads, advisors, strategic advisors, hand to the king etc. Declare your family trees. Buy strategic places via auction with a fixed amount given to each participant. The better people you have on your advisory panels, the more chances you have of winning. But do watch out for people like LittleFinger, who would slit your throat with the same dagger they equipped you with.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 3: “ ..But the pack survives”</strong><br>Form allies with other houses and bargain with the Iron bank, the farmers, miners and blacksmiths to gather resources like food, gold, weapons. To make things interesting special resources such as dragon glass, dragons, giants, unsullied will also be available. The things will be handed over physically to people, eg we will make gold bars to represent gold, small army figures to represent army, similarly with the dragons etc. Gather maximum resources to tackle the final round. If you aren’t able to gather resources just remember “a small man can cast a very big shadow” through his allies and knowledge and what Jon Snow said “The long night is coming, and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them, the free folk can’t stop them, the Night’s Watch can’t stop them and all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough but at least we’ll give them a fight.”</p>
				<p><strong>Round 4: “The Great War”</strong><br>Buy your castles (here comes the second opportunity to buy get strategic places.), stock up your granaries, erect the big walls, ready your army for the dead have arrived. The battle with the dead will be simulated in this round. You will have a map of the seven kingdoms and all the representations of the all the castles will be placed on the map. All the participants will be divided according to their alliances and put into separate places. In each place a similar map of the seven kingdoms will be presented and after each 10 minutes all the maps will be updated according to the reactions and planning going in each room. The armies of different kingdoms would be moving. The movements of the dead army will be shown and updated continuously, crisis will be popping up every second, it will be chaos all over and your response to it decides it all. This will be a 24 hour war from 5pm on the third day to 5pm last day. You will have breaks during the day as there are in a real war. Your resources and allies will come to your rescue. Your success depends upon how well you use and exploit your resources. In the end just remember the words of Tyrion Lannister “Death is so final, yet life is full of possibilities” and “Burn them all”!</p>

				<h2>The Enigma of Lock</h2>
				<p>Each of us is carving a stone, erecting a column, or cutting a piece of stained glass in the construction of something much bigger than ourselves. Man’s “magic” is another man’s engineering. “Supernatural” is a null word.<br>No one can imagine construction without any binding material (cement, rods, etc.). In this event, formation of tunnel with the help of specific material is made but without help of cement and rods.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 1</strong><br>In this round the participants are required to perform 3 tasks within a time span of 3 minutes.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 2</strong><br>1. In this round the participants are provided with the pictures of the famous tunnels across the world Along with their names<br>2. The participants require to memorize the names of the tunnels for a particular time. Later the names will be erased and the participants will be required to write the names of the tunnels with the pictures provided.</p>
				<p>Round 3<br>1. In this round, participant’s perception and modelling abilities are checked.<br>2. A prototype of the tunnel is provided to the participants and they are required to make a 2D model in AutoCAD software.<br>3. It is actually 2D visualization of the given 3D model by using AutoCAD software.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 4</strong><br>1. Using Styrofoam the participants have to make a tunnel.<br>2. Before the making of the tunnel, a semi- cylindrical shaped structure has to be made using plastic material provided and clips which will become the base of the tunnel.<br>3. Now, the Styrofoam has to be cut into desired Trapezoidal shapes and placed one beside the other on the plastic base made.<br>4. This process is continued from both sides till we get a tunnel shaped structure.<br>5. And later the semicircular structure is removed. Care has to be taken, when the base is removed the above tunnel structure doesn't fall.</p>
				<ul>
					<p><strong>JUDGING CRITERIA:</strong></p>
					<li>
						The structure will be judged based on its stability.
					</li>
					<li>Weights will be added in the structure, the one which can sustain more weight will be the winner.</li>
					<li>Judgement will be based on time taken.</li>

				<h2>Bridge the hydraulics</h2>
				<p>You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful structure in the world. But it requires people to convert that dream into reality. The road of construction is always incomplete without the tools required for construction.<br>This event will let you build your own tools. So don’t restrict yourself to the already existing ones, think out of the box. Let your creativity and innovation be put to work and create something that would make the world amaze.</p>
				<p><strong>Round 1: A GAME OF LEGO</strong><br>Participants will be provided with a metal measure tape using which they have to roll a ball into glasses containing Legos. Every ball placed into a glass will unlock a lego piece using which they have to make a building.</p>

				<h2>Game of domes</h2>
				<p>Designers learn how to handle the complexity, rather than shy away from it, and to realize that the big art of design is to make complicated things simple. It took centuries for the world to believe in spheres. Well, people believed in a flat Earth, didn't they? Constructing one has had its own complexity but can it be made simple? Maybe a dome could do you good. We bring to you an event that will test your imagination, creativity and practical knowledge. Design a plan on AutoCAD and then turn it into reality.</p>
				<p><strong>ROUND 1: Pin it to win it</strong><br>The participants are made to play a game where they will throw a ring onto rolling pins from a certain distance. Each rolling pin will contain a certain task under it which the participant must complete within minimum time.</p>
				<p><strong>ROUND 2: Build your Pisa</strong><br>This round will test the technical and creative skills of the participants. They will have to stack glasses and a sheet of hard paper alternately to a level of 4 stacks. After which, by pulling the sheet of paper the top cup should land exactly above the bottom cup. Doing so, the participant can proceed to the next level of stack only after answering a question.</p>
				<p><strong>ROUND 3: Can you CAD it?</strong><br>Love designing, but not on paper? Then why restrict yourself to just paper and pen when you have a wide range of software which make designing possible on your desktop. The participants will be required to design a specific problem in the AutoCAD software which will be given on the spot within a given timeframe.</p>
				<p><strong>ROUND 4: Domes Day</strong><br>Do you ever wonder how the marvellous structures around the world are constructed? The science behind their awe- inspiring shapes and designs? Ever wondered how those beautiful domes of Taj Mahal were created? Do you dream of creating something like that? This round will give you the chance to create a dome of a given diameter with the help of matchsticks and adhesives.</p>
				<ul>
					<p><strong>JUDGING CRITERIA:</strong></p>
					<li>The time taken by the participant will be checked.</li>
					<li>Round two will mainly be judged on the usage of materials and creativity along with the time consumed.</li>
					<li>Round three will be judged on the basis of the correctness of the answer.</li>
					<li>Round four will specifically be judged on the dimensions and stability of the structure.</li>
