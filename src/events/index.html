				<h2>NEED FOR SPEED</h2>
				<p>Want to get the feeling of adrenaline rush like you are riding a beemer? Then you have reached the correct place. Fast cars are cool but it's high time we upgrade ourselves with fast moving robots. So for you we have curated an event where your remote-controlled robot can race with other bots. Build a robot which can trace the path in the shortest time.<br>Get ready to witness race against time!! </p>

			<div id="walle" class="modal">
				<h2>WALL E</h2>
				<p>I am sure everyone has already fallen in love with WALL-E. We need more such intelligent robots to alter mankind, so we are gearing you up already through this event.
