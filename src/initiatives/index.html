				<h2>ORGANIC FARMING CAMPAIGN</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices.</p>
				<p>Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It is defined by the use of fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion plant. The need of Organic farming campaign is for Environmental Sustainability and food security. Organic farming extensively relies on nourishing the soil naturally by using compost, natural mineral powders and green manure.Organic Food Industry is Growing Fast and Guarantees High Profitability. This Campaign has various pros which is good for the environment. Organic farming reduces exposure to pesticides and chemicals. This type of practice helps in building healthy soil. Earth is facing a severe problem of global warming and with the practice of organic farming we can control the effects of global warming. In this organic farming campaign our main target is to involve farmers.</p>
				<p>The main approach for this campaign will be our farmers living in village because it’s their hard work which can change the revolution of farming. Secondly it approaches to their families because in many places most of the families practice small cultivation in the small land maybe in veranda so we can approach them for practicing organic farming in that place. This little knowledge of the alternative can enlighten many to change the ways and switch to aneco-friendly technique.</p>

				<h2>LITER OF LIGHT</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Edison did change lives of humans with his colossal invention of bulb but we do need reconstruction and renewable so that the boon remains a boon. Pushing up SDG 11 liter of lights is the campaign which sights towards provision of the basic facility of light in small villages. The problem of electricity availability is faces in much larger areas of India and the affordability is another problem. Another muddle one must look into is the way the electricity is generated; it is high time to turn towards clean electricity. Liter of light hence gives the opportunity towards resolving all these.</p>
				<p>In this campaign lights are distributed to mobile area where electricity is Unavailable; the lights generate electric current through solar energy that is green energy. The portable light is charged by solar panels, they need to be kept in light to be charged during the day. This campaign offers the villages an improved condition of living using solar technology.</p>

				<h2>WEDNESDAY SPEAKS</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>We all might have various diverse interests and are keen about things untouched by our text books.Every interesting fields and topics are discussed and taught by different teachers from SRM every Wednesday on the recurring 'Wednesday Speaks’ Ranging from personality development to scholastic education, different faculties of our institution do their best job in figuring out different ways of teaching us how and why things happen.</p>
				<p>It is a platform where every week a lecturer is invited to give a speech on a particular topic. The lecturers are invited from various departments like Medical, Engineering etc. The lecturer explains the topic though a Power Point Presentation. The whole event completes in around two hours. Then an interactive session takes place in which students are allowed to ask questions to quench their curiosity. They take out valuable time out of their schedule to explain us how things work, why things behave in certain manners or how to create these things that they discuss upon.Just because you are of a certain department doesn't prevent you from learning things that are outside your scholastic schedule. Even Sir Gregor Johann Mendel who discovered genetics was an abbot who specialized in mathematics. And SRM completely agrees on this fact, which has presented us with these valuable sessions of what we call the Wednesday Speaks.</p>
				<p>And as they say, 'brute force wins you fights while knowledge wins you wars' This strengthens the bonds between the faculty and the student. It most importantly bridges the gap of classroom learning and experiences.</p>
