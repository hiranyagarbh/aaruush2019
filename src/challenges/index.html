			<div class="content">
				<p>Rivers are the bloodlines of a country. From early civilizations to modern metropolitans, they have all survived on the banks of rivers.
					But if the bloodline dries, the nation will perish. The effects of climate change are visible not only in the polar regions, but also on the coastlines.
					Keeping this in mind, team Aaruush presents to you Revival of Rivers, a challenge where participants instigate, ideate and innovate strategies and technologies that will help in preserving the quality of our rivers.
					Let us make an effort to keep our planet Blue!</p>
